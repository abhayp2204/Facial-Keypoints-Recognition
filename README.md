# Facial-Keypoints-Detection
The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. Detecting faces is a very challenging problem. Facial features vary vastly from one individual to another. Even for a single individual, there will be variations due to 3D pose, position, viewing angle, illumination etc. Computer vision has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there is still room for improvement.

## Applications
* Tracking Faces in images and video
* Facial Expression Analysis
* Medical Diagnosis
* Biometrics
